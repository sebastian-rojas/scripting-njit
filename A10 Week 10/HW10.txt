Make a program that prints each line of its input that mentions fred. (It
shouldn’t do anything for other lines of input.) Does it match if your input string
is Fred, frederick, or Alfred? Make a small text file with a few lines mentioning
“fred flintstone” and his friends, then use that file as input to this program and the
ones later in this section.

while (<>) {
if (/fred/) {
print;
 }
}

7-2) 

Modify the previous program to allow Fred to match as well. Does it match
now if your input string is Fred, frederick, or Alfred? (Add lines with these names
to the text file.)

Here’s one way to do it: change the pattern used in the first exercise’s answer
to /[fF]red/. You could also have tried /(f|F)red/ or /fred|Fred/, but the character
class is more efficient.
